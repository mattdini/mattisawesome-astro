A talk/presentation on how we, finance folks, can use AI and LLMs in our work.  It covered the basics of what AI is, how LLMs work (math!), what they can do, what they can't, and how we can use them in our jobs.

## Why?

We hear everyday that AI is changing the world, about how it can do everything via magic.  I wanted to learn about how LLMs worked, from the ground up, and share the learnings with the business.
