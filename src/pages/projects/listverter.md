A simple utility page to convert lists. Convert CSV columns to SQL IN lists, and more.
100% Offline, no lists are sent to any servers.  Got tired of copy and pasting from excel to vscode, adding commas, quotes, removing weird characters all the time.


## The Features

- Offline - nothing sent to server (all client side JS)
